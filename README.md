# Rice Cooker

## Description

The Rice Cooker project is designed to be user-friendly, operating on a standard 220V power supply with a power rating of 700 watts. Its simplicity makes it accessible to everyone. The project features the ability to boil water and cook food. By default, it takes 10 minutes to boil water, and for cooking, you need to specify the cooking time in minutes and the desired temperature.

## Usage

To get started, the Rice Cooker greets you and asks if you want to turn it on. You can choose to turn the rice cooker on or off. Afterward, it prompts you to select the desired functionality: boiling water or cooking. For a better understanding of the project's capabilities, implementations are provided in JavaScript, Python, Dart, and Go.

## Bug

There is a minor bug when entering decimal values for minutes, which may result in an error.
